// 0. Remember Pre Computation is always helpful
// 1. If WA comes and you are sure about the solution, then check the constraints & edge cases.
// 2. If too many people have solved a question you are stuck on, then always remember: The solution is
//    100% easy and you need to calm down and think EASY, nothing complicated.
// 3. Read the question again after getting two wrong submissions. You are 100% missing something important
//    in the question.
// 4. If TLE comes in question, then check if one of the test cases generate infinite output.
//    It will give TLE.
// 5. If question looks unsolvable from front, try going from back. Works mostly from the back.
// 6. Stuck on implmentation? Think and then implement Data Structures that best fit the q like set,maps,stacks,queue.
// 7. Agar Question pe stuck ho and primary logic nahi aa raha dimaag mae then test case se ek pattern deduce karne ka try karo
// 8. Often Parity Is A good factor for obervation or computation
// 9. Math type questions mein bohot baar logic/pattern binary/2 ki powers se juda hua hota h ,Ex- See binary expansion of i/p and o/p
//    ; See occurence of some o/p @ some intervals which may be related to bits/powers of 2
//     or see how much times a particular value is divisible by 2
// 10.Many Times pattern/answer is related with some special numbers (min,max,both min&max, total sum ,
//    two i/p x and y of large range then ans related with some operation between x and y && same with 3 no i/p)
